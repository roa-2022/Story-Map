# Final Project Plan

## Wellbeing: Stress profiles and needs
* Amy:  is going through SOT interviews. Needs to be shown empathy and is prompt to chat about what's going on for her with HS or talk to other team members.
* Tyrone: When stressed, he gets quiet and pulls back from participating. He needs to go on walks and cookies.
* Matthew E -  His stress levels are ok now, but when he's stressed,  matt losses focus and don't overthink about other people. He needs to be asked what he's up to.
* Matthew T: under stress, he talks faster than usual. He needs the team to emphasise the need for breaks.
* Yani: When you see her frowning, not taking breaks and talking sharp, she's stressed. Ask her to go for walks or take a break. She needs affirmation words and a pat on the back.

## Expectation setting and agreements:

* What do we each want out of this time? 

To have fun, learn in the process and build a purposeful App.

* What hours will we keep?

Long weekday hours are needed until MVP. Mainly 8.30 to 5 but some team members can stay longer. Amy, Matt E, Matt T and Yani can do some work at the weekend. Tyrone will be in ALK on the weekend, and we'll wait for him for the stretch.

* What do we do when conflict arises?

We'll use our HS tools and ask for a mediator if needed. We'll agree to be open and to mention possible conflicts in stand-ups to handle in a separate conversation. We want to tackle disagreements early.

* How will we communicate, especially what hours of work will happen over the weekend?

We'll be holding check-ins, stand-ups and retros in person and using the slack outside the campus. About availability, Tyrone will be in ALK on the weekend, and we'll wait for him for the stretch. And the rest of the team is willing to work one day until MVP.  


 *How will you make decisions together? How will you handle conflict?

About decisions, people will be involved depending on the matter; if it's about a particular feature involving only two teams, those two will be in the meeting. In the stand-up, bring up the subject and see who's interested in having a meeting later.
Handle conflict: check in the morning & 4.45 checkout.
 
* How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need, both technical and non-technically?

We'll get help from facilitators or pairs when we get stuck with the tech for too long. Talk to the facilitator when we don't think it's the right technology. Get help to plan a courageous convo if needed.

* How will you make sure everyone feels included?

Listening to other people learning goals. Making sure things are communicated in stand-ups. Take a look at kanban to check available tickets. Stand up when tasks are completed. Stand up 2 min: 


* How will you work (what roles and what agile rituals will we use etc.)?

Scrum lead: Matt
Product owner: Matthew
Git Keeper: Git keeper
Vibe watcher: Yani

Check-in = 15 min after everybody is around
Check out and retro. Sprints  2 per day


* How will you survive (Will you eat together? How will you break the tension? What is your fun times plan?)

 Lunch:  around 12/12.30 duration will last, depending on the duration.
